# A-Novel-Image-Compression-Approach-Using-BWT-MTF-and-Golomb-Coding-Techniques
The project aims to reduce image size without compromising its quality. This is achieved through a multi-stage process involving the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), followed by Move-To-Front (MTF) encoding, and finally, Golomb coding. Together, these techniques enhance compression efficiency while preserving the original image fidelity
